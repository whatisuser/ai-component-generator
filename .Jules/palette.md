## 2026-04-05 - Adding visual feedback to async form submissions
**Learning:** Combining a loading spinner alongside keyboard shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl + Enter) significantly improves both perceived performance during async generation operations and the discoverability of power-user features. Users need an immediate visual cue that their keyboard shortcut worked.
**Action:** When adding shortcut submissions to forms, ensure the visual disabled/loading state applies instantly and clearly since the user's focus is usually on the input rather than the submit button.

**Learning:** When using visual toggle buttons that act as tabs or selectors (like the Desktop/Mobile viewport toggles in the Preview Panel), wrapping them in a `div` with `role="group"` and an `aria-label` makes their relationship clear to screen readers. Additionally, providing tooltips (via the `title` attribute) on disabled buttons is a highly effective way to explain *why* an action is disabled, preventing user confusion. For forms, using `aria-labelledby` to point to visible headings provides better context than hidden `sr-only` labels.

**Action:** Ensure that all toggle button groups use `role="group"` and `aria-pressed`. For disabled buttons whose state might not be immediately obvious, always provide an explanatory `title` or tooltip. Prefer `aria-labelledby` linking to visible descriptive text over hidden labels.
## 2024-05-19 - Improved Accessibility for Form Submissions

**Learning:** When using async form submissions, input fields like `<textarea>` should be disabled during the loading state to prevent users from modifying the input while a generation/submission is in progress. Additionally, if a submit button is disabled due to missing input, providing an explanatory tooltip (e.g., using the `title` attribute) helps users understand why the action is not available.

**Action:** Always add `disabled={isLoading}` to inputs during async operations. For disabled submit buttons, conditionally add a `title` attribute explaining the required action to enable it.
