## 2026-04-05 - Adding visual feedback to async form submissions
**Learning:** Combining a loading spinner alongside keyboard shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl + Enter) significantly improves both perceived performance during async generation operations and the discoverability of power-user features. Users need an immediate visual cue that their keyboard shortcut worked.
**Action:** When adding shortcut submissions to forms, ensure the visual disabled/loading state applies instantly and clearly since the user's focus is usually on the input rather than the submit button.
## 2024-05-19 - Improved Accessibility for Preview Panel and Form

**Learning:** When using visual toggle buttons that act as tabs or selectors (like the Desktop/Mobile viewport toggles in the Preview Panel), wrapping them in a `div` with `role="group"` and an `aria-label` makes their relationship clear to screen readers. Additionally, providing tooltips (via the `title` attribute) on disabled buttons is a highly effective way to explain *why* an action is disabled, preventing user confusion. For forms, using `aria-labelledby` to point to visible headings provides better context than hidden `sr-only` labels.

**Action:** Ensure that all toggle button groups use `role="group"` and `aria-pressed`. For disabled buttons whose state might not be immediately obvious, always provide an explanatory `title` or tooltip. Prefer `aria-labelledby` linking to visible descriptive text over hidden labels.
## 2026-08-14 - Adding helpful empty states to disabled form actions
**Learning:** Disabling form actions (like submit or reload buttons) when they are invalid is good, but without explanation, users may think the application is broken. Adding a simple native `title` attribute tooltip to explain *why* a button is disabled significantly improves the experience and discoverability of empty states.
**Action:** Whenever applying a disabled state to an interactive element due to missing input or application state, ensure a descriptive `title` is provided to explain the requirement.
